# Side Effects in Jetpack Compose

This repository contains sample code and explanations related to **side effects** in programming, particularly focused on functional programming concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository was created as a supplementary resource for an upcoming [Medium article](https://medium.com/) (link coming soon) that explores the concept of **side effects**, how they appear in code, and how functional programming languages aim to reduce or isolate them.

## 📌 What's Included?

Currently, this project includes working examples of:

- `LaunchedEffect`
- `rememberCoroutineScope`

#### ❗ Key Concepts Illustrated:
- State updates in Compose (`remember`, `mutableStateOf`)
- Side-effect management (`LaunchedEffect`, `rememberCoroutineScope`)
- Click event handling
- Coroutine lifecycle awareness

  
## 🛠️ Coming Soon
Additional examples for the following Compose side-effect APIs are coming soon:

- `DisposableEffect`
- `SideEffect`
